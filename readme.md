# Adding terms to PRO slim 

1. Clone the PRo slim to your Github
2. Add the PR ID to seed.txt in the correct order. (To programmatically sort seed.txt, you can run on the terminal, if you use macOS, `cat seed.txt | sort | uniq > seed.tmp.txt && mv seed.tmp.txt seed.txt`)
3. On your terminal (assuming your diretory is on the repo) run: 'sh odk.sh make all'
4. Make a pull request as usual
