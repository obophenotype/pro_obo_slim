def: "A molecular process that can be carried out by the action of a single macromolecular machine, usually via direct physical interactions with other molecular entities. Function in this sense denotes an action, or activity, that a gene product (or a complex) performs. These actions are described from two distinct but related perspectives: (1) biochemical activity, and (2) role as a component in a larger system/process." [GOC:pdt]
comment: Note that, in addition to forming the root of the molecular function ontology, this term is recommended for use for the annotation of gene products whose molecular function is unknown. When this term is used for annotation, it indicates that no information was available about the molecular function of the gene product annotated as of the date the annotation was made; the evidence code 'no data' (ND), is used to indicate this. Despite its name, this is not a type of 'function' in the sense typically defined by upper ontologies such as Basic Formal Ontology (BFO). It is instead a BFO:process carried out by a single gene product or complex.

comment: The definition above excludes protein complexes, which some also consider a protein. Those who wish to refer to a class representing both senses of the word are directed to CHEBI:36080. Note that the definition allows for experimentally-manipulated genes, and allows for artifically-produced derivatives that mimic those found naturally. Proteins (in the sense defined here) that descended from a common ancestor can be classified into families and superfamilies composed of products of evolutionarily-related genes. The domain architecture of a protein is described by the order of its constituent domains. Proteins with the same domains in the same order are defined as homeomorphic [PRO:WCB].

It contains a single-pass transmembrane domain and that show distinct expression on early hematopoietic precursors and vascular-associated tissue. Acts as a scaffold that presents selectin carbohydrate ligands in a clustered, tissue specific manner to allow for higher avidity interactions between leukocytes and endothelial cells during the inflammatory process. In common with related sialomucins (endoglycan and podocalyxin), the extracellular region is dominated by an N-terminal mucin-like domain, which is densely substituted with sialylated O-linked carbohydrates. The mucin-like region is followed by a cysteine-containing and presumably globular domain. This domain may fold into an immunoglobulin-like structure as the positions of 2 of the cysteines are conserved in the C2 set of the immunoglobulin superfamily. The cytoplasmic domain is around 73-76 residues long and highly conserved." [PMID:16720896, PMID:8983065]

This gene is present as a single copy in human and has undergone a lineage-specific duplication in mouse. CD59 antigen has a core architecture consisting of one UPAR/Ly-6 domain (Pfam:PF00021), a small domain of about 70 amino acids and containing 5 conserved disulfide bonds. It is both N- and O-glycosylated and is a GPI-anchored protein that releases soluble forms in some tissues.

comment: Category=family. Integrins are heterodimeric complexes of an alpha and a beta subunit. They are a structurally elaborate family of adhesion molecules that transmit signals bidirectionally across the plasma membrane by undergoing large-scale structural rearrangements. By regulating cell-cell and cell-matrix contacts, integrins participate in a wide-range of biological interactions including development, tissue repair, angiogenesis, inflammation and hemostasis.

def: "A relation that holds between a polymer and its constituent monomers. P has_constituent_monomer c if and only if P has_component multiple instances of c and each instance of c is covalently attached to another instance of c." [PRO:DAN]
comment: The constituent monomers need not be covalently attached in an end-to-end manner; that is, polymers with internal connections (e.g., polyubiquitin) can use this relation, as can circular polymers (e.g., plasmids) and multi-branched polymers (e.g., glycans). This relation, as non-transitive, allows one to indicate the number of instances of c.

comment: Down-propagates. The original name for this in the paper is 'specific_to'. Applicable to genes because some genes are lost in sub-species (strains) of a species.
